We group simulations by relationships between minor allele frequency (MAF) and local linkage disequilibrium at a SNP on effect size (MAF-LD coupling): BASELINE, COMMON, RARE, HIGH, LOW. In each group, we perform 12 simulations with varying polygenicity and heritability (see Methods). Additionally, we combine results from all simulations together as ALL. We plot the distributions of two Z-scores (y-axis), one on each row: (a) Z-score (=) tests whether the estimated and true NIM heritability are equal, and (b) Z-score () tests whether the estimated per-NIM heritability is the same as the per-SNP heritability of MH SNPs (see Methods). In each panel, we present results from a variance components analysis method (RHE-mc) using four different input annotations: ancestry only where ancestry is either NIM or MH, ancestry + MAF, ancestry + LD, ancestry + MAF + LD.
