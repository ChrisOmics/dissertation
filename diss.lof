\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {2.2}{\ignorespaces variant density, frequency spectra, and allele frequency comparisons for novel variants. We defined novel variants with respect to three increasing level of inclusiveness: those with called alternative alleles that are not found among 1KG (phase3) CHB+CHS populations, 1KG EAS super-population, and all 1KG populations. Note that if the alternative allele identified in our dataset represents a previously unobserved allele in 1KG, it is considered a novel variant, even if the site is otherwise variable in 1KG. (Top Left) Density of novel alleles discovered per 1000 bp, per chromosome. Chromosome 23 signifies the X chromosome. (Top Right) Distribution of alternate allele frequency of the novel alleles. For each novel allele that was common ($MAF \ge 0.05$) in our dataset, we compared its frequency to that estimated from ExAC (Bottom Left) and GNOMAD (Bottom Right) if the same allele passed quality control filters and was called in at least 2,000 (out of 8,654) or 800 (out of 1,622) East Asian chromosomes in ExAC and GNOMAD, respectively. In total, out of 82,626 common novel alleles not found in 1KG CHB+CHS, frequency comparisons were made for 644 alleles in ExAC and 40,544 alleles in GNOMAD (random 10\% of these alleles are shown here).

\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {3.1}{\ignorespaces Benchmarking approaches for estimating the heritability components of Neanderthal introgression. We group simulations by relationships between minor allele frequency (MAF) and local linkage disequilibrium at a SNP on effect size (MAF-LD coupling): BASELINE, COMMON, RARE, HIGH, LOW. In each group, we perform 12 simulations with varying polygenicity and heritability (see Methods). Additionally, we combine results from all simulations together as ALL. We plot the distributions of two Z-scores (y-axis), one on each row: (a) Z-score (=) tests whether the estimated and true NIM heritability are equal, and (b) Z-score () tests whether the estimated per-NIM heritability is the same as the per-SNP heritability of MH SNPs (see Methods). In each panel, we present results from a variance components analysis method (RHE-mc) using four different input annotations: ancestry only where ancestry is either NIM or MH, ancestry + MAF, ancestry + LD, ancestry + MAF + LD. A calibrated method is expected to have Z-scores distributed around zero and within 2 (shaded region). Among all tested approaches, only RHE-mc with ancestry + MAF + LD annotations is calibrated across simulations.\relax }}{35}{figure.caption.7}

(a) Fine mapping pipeline to identify NIMs that aims to identify genomic regions at which NIMs are likely to modulate phenotypic variation (credible NIM regions). (b) Comparison of approaches for identifying credible NIM regions. For each simulation, False Discovery Proportion (FDP) is computed for association testing compared to our pipeline (combining association testing and fine-mapping). The distributions of the FDP are shown across genetic architectures (summarized across groupings of coupling of effect size, MAF and LD) and summarized across architectures (ALL). Our approach to identifying credible NIMs decreases FDP in all studied architectures (the LOW LD setting has a median and quartiles of zero across replicates).

(d) Distribution of the ratio between the number of credible NIMs and number of tested NIMs (in the example of panel (a), the number of tested NIMs is the union of NIMs in input to the fine-mapping software (SuSiE) 1 and 2).
